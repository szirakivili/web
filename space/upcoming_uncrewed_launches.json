Each Atlas V rocket uses a Russian-built RD-180 engine burning kerosene and liquid oxygen to power its first stage and an American-built RL10 engine burning liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen to power its Centaur upper stage. The RD-180 engines are provided by RD Amross, while Aerojet Rocketdyne provides both the RL10 engines and the strap-on boosters used in some configurations. The standard payload fairing sizes are 4 or 5 meters in diameter and of various lengths. Fairings sizes as large as 7.2 m in diameter and up to 32.3 m in length have been considered. The rocket is assembled in Decatur, Alabama and Harlingen, Texas.",

Chemical propulsion is provided by thrusters from ArianeSpace. Reaction wheels, inertial measurement units, and staQr trackers are used to maintain orientation, with cold gas thrusters to desaturate the wheels. Communications are in X-band via a 60 cm diameter dish antenna. A 200 cm boom extends above the spacecraft, hosting the EMAG and ELP mNLP sensors."

Its rocket, the Electron, is a light-weight rocket and is now operating commercially. The company is also producing a variety of spacecrafts and spacecrafts components.",

The second digit indicates the number of SRB-3 solid rocket boosters attached to the base of the rocket, and can be \"0\", \"2\" or \"4\". All layouts of solid boosters are symmetrical. The letter in the end shows the length of the payload fairing, either short \"S\" or long \"L\".
