The second stage of the Starship — is designed as a long-duration cargo and passenger-carrying spacecraft. It is expected to be initially used without any booster stage at all, as part of an extensive development program to prove out launch-and-landing and iterate on a variety of design details, particularly with respect to the vehicle's atmospheric reentry.",

Established in 1941, Vandenberg Space Force Base is a space launch base, launching spacecraft from the Western Range, and also performs missile testing. The United States Space Force's Space Launch Delta 30 serves as the host delta for the base, equivalent to an Air Force air base wing. In addition to its military space launch mission, Vandenberg Space Force Base also hosts space launches for civil and commercial space entities, such as NASA and SpaceX.",

It was formerly operated by Lockheed Martin and is now operated by United Launch Alliance (ULA), a joint venture with Boeing. Each Atlas V rocket uses a Russian-built RD-180 engine burning kerosene and liquid oxygen to power its first stage and an American-built RL10 engine burning liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen to power its Centaur upper stage. The RD-180 engines are provided by RD Amross, while Aerojet Rocketdyne provides both the RL10 engines and the strap-on boosters used in some configurations. The standard payload fairing sizes are 4 or 5 meters in diameter and of various lengths. Fairings sizes as large as 7.2 m in diameter and up to 32.3 m in length have been considered. The rocket is assembled in Decatur, Alabama and Harlingen, Texas.",

Chemical propulsion is provided by thrusters from ArianeSpace. Reaction wheels, inertial measurement units, and staQr trackers are used to maintain orientation, with cold gas thrusters to desaturate the wheels. Communications are in X-band via a 60 cm diameter dish antenna. A 200 cm boom extends above the spacecraft, hosting the EMAG and ELP mNLP sensors."

It will initially be a two-stage rocket, but Soyuz 5 can be enhanced with an optional Blok DM-03 upper stage for geostationary missions.\r\n\r\nThe rocket is loosely based on the Zenit launch vehicle with a RD-171MV engine on the 1st stage, enlarged to 4.1 m in diameter, while the 2nd stage is powered by 2 RD-0124MS engines derived from engines used on the 3rd stage of the Soyuz-2.1b.

Electron is a small-lift launch vehicle designed to launch small satellites and cubesats to sun-synchronous orbit and low earth orbit. The Electron is the first orbital class rocket to use electric-pump-fed engines, powered by the 9 Rutherford engines on the first stage. It is also used as a suborbital testbed (called HASTE) for hypersonics research.",
